    <p>So you want to travel in one of the hottest states in the U.S. do you? Well you've come to the right place for it!
        Arizona is varied in it's terrain, the area around <strong><a style="text-decoration:none" href="Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a></strong> is filled with desert, mainly cacti. According to local law
        intentionally damaging a cactus is illegal. The state is filled with various locations known as indian reservations.
        Otherwise known as territories for the indian, or native american tribes. The land is owned and operated by the tribe that lives there,
        and many times is usually much less developed than other parts of the state. With the lack of local development this means you can experience
        Arizona in one of its most natural states. Arizona is home to one of the biggest in the nation, in its north-east corner, almost the entire area 
        is controlled by the reservation. <br>
        <br>
        Arizona is also highly varied in its territory, going from hot desert to pine forests, even ice cold areas capable of showing snow.
        <strong><a style="text-decoration:none" href="Flagstaff.html">Flagstaff</a></strong> is one of the coldest locations in arizona,
        the city is up on a mountain, cold enough to experience snowfall in the winter months. This results in large amounts of tourism coming from
        in the state itself to experience the snow. But even when it isn't snowing the town is still one of the coldest spots in the state.
        If you're not a person for heat, this is the place to go first.<br>
<br>
        One thing that is popular is offroading, due to the states natural areas of flat land and hills. 
        People will take ATVs, trucks and motorbikes out into the desert and start throwing up dust into the air.

          <h2>Some history of Arizona</h2>
         <p> Arizona officially gained its statehood in <strong>1912</strong>, becoming the 48th U.S. state, mainly focused on its farming and mining ability.
          However, in a tradition still noticable today older members of society began immigrating down to the state in 1945 appreciating the warmth and low costs at the time.
          Arizona originally <img src="images/Arizona.jpg"> has broken away from mexico, later becoming part of the states. But the signs of its history can be seen in many places out in the desert.
          Arizonas population was also known to fluctuate, as events like the california  gold rush caused people to settle in the area, but later leave. This would result in many ghost towns being made.
          In the civil war, arizona chose to side with the confederate states, only to be soon retaken by the union only a year later.
            <br><br>
            When it comes to native americans, the starting relationship was hostile. The local native americans constantly attacked military forts and ranches in the area. 
            However, the results that came from military operations against the indians would cause the "long walk", when in thousands of navajo indians were made to walk through the desert to an indan reservation.
            This would in turn, cause the deaths of hundreds of indians along the road, both intentonal <img style="float:left" src="images/indian reservations.png"> and unintentional. However negotiations would later start with the indians and the relationship would gradually repair.
            The local native americans would later gradually return to their own territories, and reservations began to form around these areas, with some still around today.
            Indians would ultimately gain their citizenship in 1924, and many of the military forts built for the conflict against the indians were decomissioned, with some still standing to this day.
            <br>
            <br>
            Arizonas history would ultimately end up as a state mainly around farming, and its copper mines. Today still an ever-important resource for the arizona and U.S. economy.
            In many locations mining towns can be found, filled with nothing, usually. But towns like the town of tombstone, a mining town with a mine that lasted several decades still exist, and are still populated.
            Arizona was also highly desirable to many ranchers coming from texas, and arizona was rapidly taken over by ranching. With cheap prices for lots of land most towns that weren't dedicated to mining were filled with ranching.
