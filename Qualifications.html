            When it comes to all of my coding qualifications, i am technically qualified to perform work in HTML5, and CSS3. Now, my overall skill level in each of these is like this:<br>
            HTML: 4/5<br>
            I'd say that i'm fairly decent/skilled in the creation of websites, in their format anyways. Though there are a few more advanced thing i'm still not to sure about.<br>
            CSS: 3.2/5<br>
            I can create some decently made website styles this way, i can spoof more advanced effects with what i know already. I know a few more advanced things such as how animations work.
