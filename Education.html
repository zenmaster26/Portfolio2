        <hr>
        <p>My general education consists of full elementary, middle, kinder, and a bit of highschool through various subjects.
            I never really began to learn about coding or website coding prior to my junior year of highschool where i began the westmec coding program.
            As such I am educated in various forms of history and science, mid-level mathematics, a degree of spanish and of course, education in HTML5 and CSS3.
